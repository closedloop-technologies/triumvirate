# Repo Guide: triumvirate

This repository contains **Triumvirate**, a Node.js/TypeScript CLI that runs code reviews across several LLM providers (OpenAI, Claude and Gemini).

## Key Directories

- `src` – TypeScript source for the CLI and library utilities.
- `dist` – Compiled JavaScript output generated by the build step.
- `scripts` – Helper scripts used by the project (e.g. test helpers).
- `test` – Vitest unit tests.
- `assets` – Images and other static resources used in documentation.

Documentation files (`README.md`, `CLI.md`, `USAGE.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `TASKS.md`) provide additional details on usage and design.

## Development

- Requires Node.js 20 or newer.
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run the tests with `npm test`.
- Build the project with `npm run build`.
- Verify linting and formatting via `npm run verify`.

Triumvirate can be executed via the `triumvirate` or `tri` commands once built, and it may also be run with `npx` directly.
