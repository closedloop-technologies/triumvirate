Conduct a detailed performance review focusing on:
1. Computational complexity analysis
2. Memory usage and potential leaks
3. Asynchronous operations and concurrency
4. Database queries and data access patterns
5. Network requests and API usage
6. Resource-intensive operations
7. Caching opportunities
8. Bundle size considerations

For each issue, estimate the performance impact and provide specific recommendations for improvement.
