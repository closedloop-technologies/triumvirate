Conduct a thorough security review focusing on:
1. Authentication and authorization vulnerabilities
2. Input validation and sanitization
3. Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, etc.)
4. Sensitive data exposure
5. Security misconfiguration
6. Hard-coded secrets or credentials
7. Insecure cryptographic storage
8. Insufficient logging and monitoring

Categorize issues by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and provide specific recommendations for each.
